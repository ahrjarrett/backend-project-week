* Deploy

- Site:
  http://18.236.166.82:7000/api/notes

- Console: 
  https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

- SSH:
  Notice we're logging in as user =ubuntu= instead of =ahrjarrett= or =root=

- OS:
Ubuntu 18

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ ssh -i backend-project.pem ubuntu@18.236.166.82
  # Once you've created a user, this will be your login!
  $ ssh -i backend-project.pem ahrjarrett.236.166.82
  $ sudo su # switch to root user
#+END_SRC

** Config

Launching on AWS EC2 instance.

- IP Address:
  18.236.166.82

- Remote in:

  =ssh -i backend-project.pem ahrjarrett.236.166.82=, them =sudo su=
  
*Note:* Make sure you run =chmod 0400 <path-to-pemfile>=, otherwise AWS will complain that it's not secure!

*** Create a user with sudo privileges

Login as root, then do:

=adduser ahrjarrett=
=usermod -aG sudo ahrjarrett=
=su ahrjarrett=

** Installing Node

Installing version 10.x

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
  $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
#+END_SRC


** Setting up the app

Going to create our directory from home and call it =workspace=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ cd ~
  $ mkdir workspace
#+END_SRC

Now clone your repo, install dependencies, and run the app.

*** Exposing the app's port

EC2 needs to know which port to expose.

1. Go to the AWS console and click "NETWORK & SECURITY" >> *Security Groups*
2. Select the group name =launch-wizard-X=
3. Select the *Inbound* tab and click *Edit*, *Add Rule*

   | Type       | Protocol | Port Range | Source   | Description |
   |------------+----------+------------+----------+-------------|
   | Custom TCP | TCP      |       7000 | Anywhere | [Optional]  |
   
Now navigate to http://18.236.166.82:7000/ and you should see your dumb app running!


** Setting up your git repo

[[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-automatic-deployment-with-git-with-a-vps][Followed these instructions]]

1. Create =/root/repo= directory
2. Create =/root/repo/<PROJECT-NAME>.git= directory
3. Navigate there and run =git init --bare=
4. Touch =hooks/post-receive= file
5. Make it an executable with =chmod +x hooks/post-receive=
6. Put this in there:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     #!/bin/sh
     git --work-tree=/root/workspace/<PROJECT-NAME> --git-dir=/root/repo/<PROJECT-NAME.git checkout -f
   #+END_SRC
   
7. Link local repo with remote

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git remote add live ssh://ahrjarrett@18.236.166.82/root/repo/hello-world-node-express.git
#+END_SRC
